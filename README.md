**Application Summary:**<br>
The application, StakeMate, is a sports betting application which will be implemented as an educational, play-money sports-betting exchange. It will be an application where users place and match orders on game outcomes using a daily-updated data feed (24-hour API refresh) and automatic post-game settlement.

**User Stories:**<br>
User Story 1 (implemeneted by Firas Adnan Jalil): As a sports bettor, I wish to see continuously updated data, so that I can stay informed about the market.

User Story 2 (implemented by Gary Choi): As a sports bettor, I want to browse active matches, see each market's live order book, and use clear buy/sell controls, so that I can place (fake-money) bets quickly and know when a market closes.

User Story 3 (implemented by Yibo Sun): As a sports bettor, I want my account, bankroll, and bets to be safely stored in the database and for screens to update automatically when data changes, so that I always see accurate balances and market status without refreshing.

User Story 4 (implemented by Tarunraj Kalyanasundaram): As a sports bettor, I want to place limit and market orders on any open market and have them matched fairly and immediately, so that I can buy/sell at my chosen price or at the best available price.

User Story 5 (implemented by Erzheng Zhang): As a sports bettor, I wish to leave public comments regarding the market, so that I can interact with other users about sports betting.

User Story 6 (implemented by Abdulghafur Alshanqiti): As a sports bettor, I would like to find out if I won or lost, so that I can see how much money I won or lost.
